# SecretAlpha - So long, and thanks for all the fish

See screenshots at the bottom.

The code for the Secret Republic hacker simulation role playing game.

Futuristic UI. Mission designer. Audio AI voice speaks when interacting with the game.

A lot of work has gone into this but it is not a documented (as of yet) project.

It's been through years of development with this being its 3rd full do-over.

However, the project on stand-by so I've decided to make the source available of nothing else
